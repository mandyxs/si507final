# Mandy Shen's Final Project

This program crawls soccer data from html pages and displays analysis on plotly graphs

## Data Source: http://www.soccerstats.com/
* The program crawls 100+ pages from this source, it will take a while to crawl
* If you crawl all of them at the same time the website may go down (this happened when I crawled the pages, not sure if I was the reason that the site was down)

## Plotly API
* This programs uses 4 graphs on Plotly, you will need to have Plotly installed and an API key in order to access the graphs. Please visit this link: https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/ to setup Plotly

## Code Walkthrough

### final_data.py
This is the file that handles all the crawling and inserting data into database
* class Database: this class includes methods needed to init the data base as well as inserting html data into database
* functions start with 'get': these functions crawls html pages and extracts useful data from html content

### final_main.py
This is the file that you would run to interact with the program. This file calls all the functions in final_data.py. It also manages all the command line interactions as well as plotly functions. 
* class databse_select: this is the class that has all the methods needed to analyze and select data from the database to implemenet the plotly functions
* functions plot_rank & plot_goal & team_chart & plot_player: these are the functions that generate plotly graphs
* function interactive_prompt: this is the function that implements command line interaction

### final_unittest.py
Unittest file
